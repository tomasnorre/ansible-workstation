# ansible-workstation
This is a small ansible collection of playbooks that I find handy to setup my workstation

Disclaimer: These playbooks are all based on debian based Linux Distributions.

## How to use this

Running the following command will add the software collection that is automated so far, will extend this on the way. 

```shel
$ ansible-playbook workstation.yaml
```
